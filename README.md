# Welcome To My Portfolio!

This is a collection of my programming work and my personal information. I have made several portfolios over my time learning but this one was especially enjoyable to create. I wanted a more neon style that incorporated intersectional observation. I used SCSS to add some style along with the javascript. This portfolio is mobile friendly and responsive. 

# Forms

You may reach out to me using the forms at the bottom. The forms are using Form Submit, a fantastic resource which emails me with responses. 

# Photoshop

While this portfolio doesn't show case my full capabilities I did utilize my skills with photoshop to do some work with logos. I have used photoshop as a hobby for years and programming has allowed me to fully utilize it in a professional capacity.
